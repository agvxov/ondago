# Example - core
We have got ourselves a nice project.
Its structure is as simple as everything else about it,
which is just perfect.
Everything is located where you would first expect it to be.

Now comes the trouble: we wish to go on a prototyping rampage,
but we dont want to constantly reopen our application.

Therefor we wish to reach for some sort of hot-reloading.
